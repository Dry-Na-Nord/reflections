How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was easie and faster to find the typo.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It will speed up programming process and bugs lookup.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros: Easier tracking versions of the same file.
Cons: None

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while other, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because programming demands intersection of multiple files, so all files must be saved at same time to easily track right version of file(s).

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log allows to see chronlogical list of all commits to a single repository. Git diff allows to compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It's easier to revert to file version that works.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For my programming projects.
