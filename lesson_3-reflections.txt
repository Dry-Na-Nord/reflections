When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work on same projects from different computers or when you work in a team of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you want control over the versions in both local and cloud repository.
