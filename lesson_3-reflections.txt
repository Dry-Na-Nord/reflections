When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work on same projects from different computers or when you work in a team of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you want control over the versions in both local and cloud repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are remote clones, and clones are copies of a repository on local drive. Branch is group of commits (changes) made to one repository that can be reached from one position.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can continue work on the repository while being offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be harder without version control.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When I make some experimental feature that should be reviewed before it can be incorporated into main branch.
